test_that("description", {
  # tests for the property `description` (character)

test_that("date_created", {
  # tests for the property `date_created` (integer)

test_that("rendered_description", {
  # tests for the property `rendered_description` (character)
  # The short description of the stream rendered as HTML, intended to be used when displaying the stream description in a UI.  One should use the standard Zulip rendered_markdown CSS when displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax work correctly.  And any client-side security logic for user-generated message content should be applied when displaying this HTML as though it were the body of a Zulip message.

test_that("message_retention_days", {
  # tests for the property `message_retention_days` (integer)
  # Number of days that messages sent to this stream will be stored before being automatically deleted by the [message retention policy](/help/message-retention-policy).  There are two special values:  * &#x60;null&#x60;, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization   level setting. * &#x60;-1&#x60; encodes retaining messages in this stream forever.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).

  # Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.  Currently always true for public streams (i.e. invite_only&#x3D;False implies history_public_to_subscribers&#x3D;True), but clients should not make that assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

test_that("first_message_id", {
  # tests for the property `first_message_id` (integer)
  # The id of the first message in the stream.  Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display UI like the \&quot;more topics\&quot; widget that would suggest the stream has older history that can be accessed.  Null is used for streams with no message history.

  #expect_equal(model.instance$`first_message_id`, "EXPECTED_RESULT")
})

test_that("is_announcement_only", {
  # tests for the property `is_announcement_only` (character)
  # Whether the given stream is announcement only or not.  **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1), use &#x60;stream_post_policy&#x60; instead.

  #expect_equal(model.instance$`is_announcement_only`, "EXPECTED_RESULT")

  # tests for the property `date_sent` (integer)
  # Time when the message was sent as a UNIX timestamp multiplied by 1000 (matching the format of getTime() in JavaScript).  **Changes**: Changed in Zulip 2.2 (feature level 22).  This field was previously strangely called &#x60;name&#x60; and was a floating point number.

test_that("id", {
  # tests for the property `id` (integer)
  # The unique message ID.  Messages should always be displayed sorted by ID.

  #expect_equal(model.instance$`id`, "EXPECTED_RESULT")

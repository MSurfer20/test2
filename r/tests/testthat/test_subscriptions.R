  # Number of days that messages sent to this stream will be stored before being automatically deleted by the [message retention policy](/help/message-retention-policy).  There are two special values:  * &#x60;null&#x60;, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization   level setting. * &#x60;-1&#x60; encodes retaining messages in this stream forever.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).

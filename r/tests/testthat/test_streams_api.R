  # Subscribe to a stream
  # Subscribe one or more users to one or more streams.  &#x60;POST {{ api_url }}/v1/users/me/subscriptions&#x60;  If any of the specified streams do not exist, they are automatically created.  The initial [stream settings](/api/update-stream) will be determined by the optional parameters like &#x60;invite_only&#x60; detailed below. 
  # @param subscriptions array[object] A list of dictionaries containing the key `name` and value specifying the name of the stream to subscribe. If the stream does not exist a new stream is created. The description of the stream created can be specified by setting the dictionary key `description` with an appropriate value. 
  # @param principals array[OneOfstringinteger] A list of user ids (preferred) or Zulip display email addresses of the users to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the streams specified in the `subscriptions` parameter. If not provided, then the requesting user/bot is subscribed.  **Changes**: The integer format is new in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 9).  (optional)
  # @param authorization.errors.fatal character A boolean specifying whether authorization errors (such as when the requesting user is not authorized to access a private stream) should be considered fatal or not. When `True`, an authorization error is reported as such. When set to `False`, the response will be a 200 and any streams where the request encountered an authorization error will be listed in the `unauthorized` key.  (optional)
  # @param announce character If one of the streams specified did not exist previously and is thus craeted by this call, this determines whether [notification bot](/help/configure-notification-bot) will send an announcement about the new stream's creation.  (optional)
  # @param invite.only character As described above, this endpoint will create a new stream if passed a stream name that doesn't already exist.  This parameters and the ones that follow are used to request an initial configuration of a created stream; they are ignored for streams that already exist.  This parameter determines whether any newly created streams will be private streams.  (optional)
  # @param history.public.to.subscribers character Whether the stream's message history should be available to newly subscribed members, or users can only access messages they actually received while subscribed to the stream.  Corresponds to the [shared history](/help/stream-permissions) option in documentation.  (optional)
  # @param stream.post.policy integer Policy for which users can post messages to the stream.  * 1 => Any user can post. * 2 => Only administrators can post. * 3 => Only full members can post. * 4 => Only moderators can post.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0, replacing the previous `is_announcement_only` boolean.  (optional)
  # @param message.retention.days OneOfstringinteger Number of days that messages sent to this stream will be stored before being automatically deleted by the [message retention policy](/help/message-retention-policy).  Two special string format values are supported:  * \"realm_default\" => Return to the organization-level setting. * \"forever\" => Retain messages forever.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).

  # @param stream.id integer The ID of the stream to access. 
  # @param description character The new description for the stream. Limited Zulip markdown is allowed in this field.  **Changes**: Removed unnecessary JSON-encoding of this parameter in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 64).  (optional)
  # @param new.name character The new name for the stream.  **Changes**: Removed unnecessary JSON-encoding of this parameter in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 64).  (optional)

test_that("UpdateSubscriptionSettings", {
  # tests for UpdateSubscriptionSettings
  # base path: https://example.zulipchat.com/api/v1
  # Update subscription settings
  # This endpoint is used to update the user&#39;s personal settings for the streams they are subscribed to, including muting, color, pinning, and per-stream notification settings.  &#x60;POST {{ api_url }}/v1/users/me/subscriptions/properties&#x60; 
  # @param subscription.data array[object] A list of objects that describe the changes that should be applied in each subscription. Each object represents a subscription, and must have a `stream_id` key that identifies the stream, as well as the `property` being modified and its new `value`.  The possible values for each `property` and `value` pairs are:  * `color` (string): the hex value of the user's display color for the stream. * `is_muted` (boolean): whether the stream is   [muted](/help/mute-a-stream).  Prior to Zulip 2.1, this feature was   represented by the more confusingly named `in_home_view` (with the   opposite value, `in_home_view=!is_muted`); for   backwards-compatibility, modern Zulip still accepts that value. * `pin_to_top` (boolean): whether to pin the stream at the top of the stream list. * `desktop_notifications` (boolean): whether to show desktop notifications     for all messages sent to the stream. * `audible_notifications` (boolean): whether to play a sound   notification for all messages sent to the stream. * `push_notifications` (boolean): whether to trigger a mobile push     notification for all messages sent to the stream. * `email_notifications` (boolean): whether to trigger an email     notification for all messages sent to the stream.

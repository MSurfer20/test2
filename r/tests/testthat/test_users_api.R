  # @param client.gravatar character Whether the client supports computing gravatars URLs.  If enabled, `avatar_url` will be included in the response only if there is a Zulip avatar, and will be `null` for users who are using gravatar as their avatar.

Full Zulip clients like mobile/desktop apps will want to use the main presence endpoint, which returns data for all active users in the organization, instead.  &#x60;GET {{ api_url }}/v1/users/{user_id_or_email}/presence&#x60;  See [Zulip&#39;s developer documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/presence.html) for details on the data model for presence in Zulip.

  # Mute a user
  # This endpoint [mutes a user](/help/mute-a-user).  Messages sent by users you&#39;ve muted will be automatically marked as read and hidden.  &#x60;POST {{ api_url }}/v1/users/me/muted_users/{muted_user_id}&#x60;  Muted users should be implemented by clients as follows:  * The server will immediately mark all messages sent by the muted   user as read.  This will automatically clear any existing mobile   push notifications related to the muted user. * The server will mark any new messages sent by the muted user as read   for your account, which prevents all email and mobile push notifications. * Clients should exclude muted users from presence lists or other UI   for viewing or composing 1:1 private messages. 1:1 private messages sent by   muted users should be hidden everywhere in the Zulip UI. * Stream messages and group private messages sent by the muted   user should avoid displaying the content and name/avatar,   but should display that N messages by a muted user were   hidden (so that it is possible to interpret the messages by   other users who are talking with the muted user). * Group private message conversations including the muted user   should display muted users as \&quot;Muted user\&quot;, rather than   showing their name, in lists of such conversations, along with using   a blank grey avatar where avatars are displayed. * Administrative/settings UI elements for showing \&quot;All users that exist   on this stream or realm\&quot;, e.g. for organization   administration or showing stream subscribers, should display   the user&#39;s name as normal.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 48).

  # Set \&quot;typing\&quot; status
  # Notify other users whether the current user is typing a message.  &#x60;POST {{ api_url }}/v1/typing&#x60;  Clients implementing Zulip&#39;s typing notifications protocol should work as follows:  * Send a request to this endpoint with &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;start\&quot;&#x60; when a user starts typing a message,   and also every &#x60;TYPING_STARTED_WAIT_PERIOD&#x3D;10&#x60; seconds that the user continues to   actively type or otherwise interact with the compose UI (E.g. interacting with the   compose box emoji picker). * Send a request to this endpoint with &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;stop\&quot;&#x60; when a user pauses using the   compose UI for at least &#x60;TYPING_STOPPED_WAIT_PERIOD&#x3D;5&#x60; seconds or cancels   the compose action (if it had previously sent a \&quot;start\&quot; operation for that   compose action). * Start displaying \&quot;Sender is typing\&quot; for a given conversation when the client   receives an &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;start\&quot;&#x60; event from the [events API](/api/get-events). * Continue displaying \&quot;Sender is typing\&quot; until they receive an &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;stop\&quot;&#x60; event   from the [events API](/api/get-events) or &#x60;TYPING_STARTED_EXPIRY_PERIOD&#x3D;15&#x60;   seconds have passed without a new &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;start\&quot;&#x60; event for that conversation. * Clients that support displaying stream typing notifications (new in Zulip 4.0)   should indicate they support processing stream typing events via the   &#x60;stream_typing_notifications&#x60; in the &#x60;client_capabilities&#x60; parameter to &#x60;/register&#x60;.  This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications implementation to be stateless while being resilient; network failures cannot result in a user being incorrectly displayed as perpetually typing.  See [the typing notification docs](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/typing-indicators.html) for additional design details on Zulip&#39;s typing notifications protocol. 
  # @param op character Whether the user has started (`start`) or stopped (`stop`) to type. 
  # @param to array[integer] For 'private' type it is the user_ids of the recipients of the message being typed. Send a JSON-encoded list of user_ids. (Use a list even if there is only one recipient.)  For 'stream' type it is a single element list containing ID of stream in which the message is being typed.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 2.0, this parameter accepted only a JSON-encoded list of email addresses.  Support for the email address-based format was removed in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 11). 
  # @param type character Type of the message being composed.  (optional)

  # Update settings
  # This endpoint is used to edit the current user&#39;s settings.  &#x60;PATCH {{ api_url }}/v1/settings&#x60;  **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this endpoint only supported the &#x60;full_name&#x60;, &#x60;email&#x60;, &#x60;old_password&#x60;, and &#x60;new_password&#x60; parameters. Notification settings were managed by &#x60;PATCH /settings/notifications&#x60;, and all other settings by &#x60;PATCH /settings/display&#x60;. The feature level 80 migration to merge these endpoints did not change how request parameters are encoded. Note, however, that it did change the handling of any invalid parameters present in a request to change notification or display settings, since the merged endpoint uses the new response format that was introduced for &#x60;/settings&#x60; in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 78).  The &#x60;/settings/display&#x60; and &#x60;/settings/notifications&#x60; endpoints are now deprecated aliases for this endpoint for backwards-compatibility, and will be removed once clients have migrated to use this endpoint. 
  # @param full.name character A new display name for the user.  (optional)
  # @param email character Asks the server to initiate a confirmation sequence to change the user's email address to the indicated value. The user will need to demonstrate control of the new email address by clicking a confirmation link sent to that address.  (optional)
  # @param old.password character The user's old Zulip password (or LDAP password, if LDAP authentication is in use).  Required only when sending the `new_password` parameter.  (optional)

  # @param twenty.four.hour.time character Whether time should be [displayed in 24-hour notation](/help/change-the-time-format).  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint.  (optional)
  # @param dense.mode character This setting has no effect at present.  It is reserved for use in controlling the default font size in Zulip.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint.  (optional)
  # @param starred.message.counts character Whether clients should display the [number of starred messages](/help/star-a-message#display-the-number-of-starred-messages).  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint.

(optional)
  # @param enable.drafts.synchronization character A boolean parameter to control whether synchronizing drafts is enabled for the user. When synchronization is disabled, all drafts stored in the server will be automatically deleted from the server.  This does not do anything (like sending events) to delete local copies of drafts stored in clients.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 87).  (optional)
  # @param translate.emoticons character Whether to [translate emoticons to emoji](/help/enable-emoticon-translations) in messages the user sends.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint.  (optional)
  # @param default.language character What [default language](/help/change-your-language) to use for the account.  This controls both the Zulip UI as well as email notifications sent to the user.  The value needs to be a standard language code that the Zulip server has translation data for; for example, `\"en\"` for English or `\"de\"` for German.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint.

  # @param user.id integer The target user's ID. 
  # @param client.gravatar character Whether the client supports computing gravatars URLs.  If enabled, `avatar_url` will be included in the response only if there is a Zulip avatar, and will be `null` for users who are using gravatar as their avatar.

You can also fetch details on [all users in the organization](/api/get-users) or [by user ID](/api/get-user).

Full Zulip clients like mobile/desktop apps will want to use the main presence endpoint, which returns data for all active users in the organization, instead.  &#x60;GET {{ api_url }}/v1/users/{user_id_or_email}/presence&#x60;  See [Zulip&#39;s developer documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/presence.html) for details on the data model for presence in Zulip.

Messages sent by users you&#39;ve muted will be automatically marked as read and hidden.  &#x60;POST {{ api_url }}/v1/users/me/muted_users/{muted_user_id}&#x60;  Muted users should be implemented by clients as follows:  * The server will immediately mark all messages sent by the muted   user as read.  This will automatically clear any existing mobile   push notifications related to the muted user. * The server will mark any new messages sent by the muted user as read   for your account, which prevents all email and mobile push notifications. * Clients should exclude muted users from presence lists or other UI   for viewing or composing 1:1 private messages. 1:1 private messages sent by   muted users should be hidden everywhere in the Zulip UI. * Stream messages and group private messages sent by the muted   user should avoid displaying the content and name/avatar,   but should display that N messages by a muted user were   hidden (so that it is possible to interpret the messages by   other users who are talking with the muted user). * Group private message conversations including the muted user   should display muted users as \&quot;Muted user\&quot;, rather than   showing their name, in lists of such conversations, along with using   a blank grey avatar where avatars are displayed. * Administrative/settings UI elements for showing \&quot;All users that exist   on this stream or realm\&quot;, e.g. for organization   administration or showing stream subscribers, should display   the user&#39;s name as normal.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 48).

  # Set \&quot;typing\&quot; status
  # Notify other users whether the current user is typing a message.  &#x60;POST {{ api_url }}/v1/typing&#x60;  Clients implementing Zulip&#39;s typing notifications protocol should work as follows:  * Send a request to this endpoint with &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;start\&quot;&#x60; when a user starts typing a message,   and also every &#x60;TYPING_STARTED_WAIT_PERIOD&#x3D;10&#x60; seconds that the user continues to   actively type or otherwise interact with the compose UI (E.g. interacting with the   compose box emoji picker). * Send a request to this endpoint with &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;stop\&quot;&#x60; when a user pauses using the   compose UI for at least &#x60;TYPING_STOPPED_WAIT_PERIOD&#x3D;5&#x60; seconds or cancels   the compose action (if it had previously sent a \&quot;start\&quot; operation for that   compose action). * Start displaying \&quot;Sender is typing\&quot; for a given conversation when the client   receives an &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;start\&quot;&#x60; event from the [events API](/api/get-events). * Continue displaying \&quot;Sender is typing\&quot; until they receive an &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;stop\&quot;&#x60; event   from the [events API](/api/get-events) or &#x60;TYPING_STARTED_EXPIRY_PERIOD&#x3D;15&#x60;   seconds have passed without a new &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;start\&quot;&#x60; event for that conversation. * Clients that support displaying stream typing notifications (new in Zulip 4.0)   should indicate they support processing stream typing events via the   &#x60;stream_typing_notifications&#x60; in the &#x60;client_capabilities&#x60; parameter to &#x60;/register&#x60;.  This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications implementation to be stateless while being resilient; network failures cannot result in a user being incorrectly displayed as perpetually typing.  See [the typing notification docs](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/typing-indicators.html) for additional design details on Zulip&#39;s typing notifications protocol. 
  # @param op character Whether the user has started (`start`) or stopped (`stop`) to type. 
  # @param to array[integer] For 'private' type it is the user_ids of the recipients of the message being typed. Send a JSON-encoded list of user_ids. (Use a list even if there is only one recipient.)  For 'stream' type it is a single element list containing ID of stream in which the message is being typed.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 2.0, this parameter accepted only a JSON-encoded list of email addresses.  Support for the email address-based format was removed in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 11). 
  # @param type character Type of the message being composed.  (optional)

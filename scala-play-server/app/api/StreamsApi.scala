The initial [stream settings](/api/update-stream) will be determined by the optional parameters like &#x60;invite_only&#x60; detailed below. 
    * @param subscriptions A list of dictionaries containing the key &#x60;name&#x60; and value specifying the name of the stream to subscribe. If the stream does not exist a new stream is created. The description of the stream created can be specified by setting the dictionary key &#x60;description&#x60; with an appropriate value. 
    * @param principals A list of user ids (preferred) or Zulip display email addresses of the users to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the streams specified in the &#x60;subscriptions&#x60; parameter. If not provided, then the requesting user/bot is subscribed.  **Changes**: The integer format is new in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 9).

When &#x60;True&#x60;, an authorization error is reported as such. When set to &#x60;False&#x60;, the response will be a 200 and any streams where the request encountered an authorization error will be listed in the &#x60;unauthorized&#x60; key. 
    * @param announce If one of the streams specified did not exist previously and is thus craeted by this call, this determines whether [notification bot](/help/configure-notification-bot) will send an announcement about the new stream&#39;s creation. 
    * @param inviteOnly As described above, this endpoint will create a new stream if passed a stream name that doesn&#39;t already exist.  This parameters and the ones that follow are used to request an initial configuration of a created stream; they are ignored for streams that already exist.  This parameter determines whether any newly created streams will be private streams. 
    * @param historyPublicToSubscribers Whether the stream&#39;s message history should be available to newly subscribed members, or users can only access messages they actually received while subscribed to the stream.  Corresponds to the [shared history](/help/stream-permissions) option in documentation.

    * @param messageRetentionDays Number of days that messages sent to this stream will be stored before being automatically deleted by the [message retention policy](/help/message-retention-policy).  Two special string format values are supported:  * \&quot;realm_default\&quot; &#x3D;&gt; Return to the organization-level setting. * \&quot;forever\&quot; &#x3D;&gt; Retain messages forever.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).

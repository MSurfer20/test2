# Whether the user is a mirror dummy. Dictionary with data on the user who added the reaction, including the user ID as the &#x60;id&#x60; field.  **Note**: In the [events API](/api/get-events), this &#x60;user&#x60; dictionary confusing had the user ID in a field called &#x60;user_id&#x60; instead.  We recommend ignoring fields other than the user ID.  **Deprecated** and to be removed in a future release once core clients have migrated to use the &#x60;user_id&#x60; field.

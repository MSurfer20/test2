type EmojiReactionBaseAllOfUser* = object
  ## Whether the user is a mirror dummy. Dictionary with data on the user who added the reaction, including the user ID as the `id` field.  **Note**: In the [events API](/api/get-events), this `user` dictionary confusing had the user ID in a field called `user_id` instead.  We recommend ignoring fields other than the user ID.  **Deprecated** and to be removed in a future release once core clients have migrated to use the `user_id` field. 
  id*: int ## ID of the user. 
  email*: string ## Email of the user. 
  fullName*: string ## Full name of the user. 
  isMirrorDummy*: bool ## Whether the user is a mirror dummy.

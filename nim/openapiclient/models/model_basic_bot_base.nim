type BasicBotBase* = object
  ## 
  userId*: int ## The user id of the bot. 
  fullName*: string ## The full name of the bot. 
  apiKey*: string ## The API key of the bot which it uses to make API requests. 
  defaultSendingStream*: string ## The default sending stream of the bot. Null if the bot doesn't have a default sending stream. 
  defaultEventsRegisterStream*: string ## The default stream for which the bot receives events/register data. Null if the bot doesn't have such a default stream. 
  defaultAllPublicStreams*: bool ## Whether the bot can send messages to all streams by default. 
  avatarUrl*: string ## The URL of the bot's avatar. 
  ownerId*: int ## The user id of the bot's owner.  Null if the bot has no owner. 
  services*: seq[oneOf<object,object>] ## The \"Services\" array contains extra configuration fields only relevant for Outgoing webhook bots and Embedded bots.  It is always a single-element array.  We consider this part of the Zulip API to be unstable; it is used only for UI elements for administering bots and is likely to change.

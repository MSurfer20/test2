Notification settings were managed by `PATCH /settings/notifications`, and all other settings by `PATCH /settings/display`. The feature level 80 migration to merge these endpoints did not change how request parameters are encoded. Note, however, that it did change the handling of any invalid parameters present in a request to change notification or display settings, since the merged endpoint uses the new response format that was introduced for `/settings` in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 78).  The `/settings/display` and `/settings/notifications` endpoints are now deprecated aliases for this endpoint for backwards-compatibility, and will be removed once clients have migrated to use this endpoint.

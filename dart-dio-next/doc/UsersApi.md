# **getUser**
> JsonSuccessBase getUser(userId, clientGravatar, includeCustomProfileFields)

Get a user

Fetch details for a single user in the organization.  `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/users/{user_id}`  You can also fetch details on [all users in the organization](/api/get-users) or [by email](/api/get-user-by-email).  *This endpoint is new in Zulip Server 3.0 (feature level 1).* 

### Example 
```dart
import 'package:openapi/api.dart';

final api = Openapi().getUsersApi();
final int userId = 12; // int | The target user's ID. 
final bool clientGravatar = true; // bool | Whether the client supports computing gravatars URLs.  If enabled, `avatar_url` will be included in the response only if there is a Zulip avatar, and will be `null` for users who are using gravatar as their avatar.  This option significantly reduces the compressed size of user data, since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if clients can compute their own gravatars. 
final bool includeCustomProfileFields = true; // bool | Whether the client wants [custom profile field](/help/add-custom-profile-fields) data to be included in the response.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 2.1.0.  Previous versions do no offer these data via the API. 

try { 
    final response = api.getUser(userId, clientGravatar, includeCustomProfileFields);
    print(response);
} catch on DioError (e) {
    print('Exception when calling UsersApi->getUser: $e\n');
}
```

### Parameters

 **clientGravatar** | **bool**| Whether the client supports computing gravatars URLs.  If enabled, `avatar_url` will be included in the response only if there is a Zulip avatar, and will be `null` for users who are using gravatar as their avatar.  This option significantly reduces the compressed size of user data, since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if clients can compute their own gravatars.  | [optional] [default to false]

# **getUserByEmail**
> JsonSuccessBase getUserByEmail(email, clientGravatar, includeCustomProfileFields)

Get a user by email

Fetch details for a single user in the organization given a Zulip display email address.  `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/users/{email}`  Note that this endpoint uses Zulip display emails addresses for organizations that have configured limited [email address visibility](/help/restrict-visibility-of-email-addresses).  You can also fetch details on [all users in the organization](/api/get-users) or [by user ID](/api/get-user).  Fetching by user ID is generally recommended when possible, as users can [change their email address](/help/change-your-email-address).  *This endpoint is new in Zulip Server 4.0 (feature level 39).* 

### Example 
```dart
import 'package:openapi/api.dart';

final api = Openapi().getUsersApi();
final String email = iago@zulip.com; // String | The email address of the user whose details you want to fetch. 
final bool clientGravatar = true; // bool | Whether the client supports computing gravatars URLs.  If enabled, `avatar_url` will be included in the response only if there is a Zulip avatar, and will be `null` for users who are using gravatar as their avatar.

# **getUserPresence**
> JsonSuccessBase getUserPresence(userIdOrEmail)

Get user presence

Get the presence status for a specific user.  This endpoint is most useful for embedding data about a user's presence status in other sites (E.g. an employee directory).  Full Zulip clients like mobile/desktop apps will want to use the main presence endpoint, which returns data for all active users in the organization, instead.  `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/users/{user_id_or_email}/presence`  See [Zulip's developer documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/presence.html) for details on the data model for presence in Zulip. 

### Example 
```dart
import 'package:openapi/api.dart';

final api = Openapi().getUsersApi();
final String userIdOrEmail = iago@zulip.com; // String | The user_id or Zulip display email address of the user whose presence you want to fetch.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 43). Previous versions only supported identifying the user by Zulip display email. 

try { 
    final response = api.getUserPresence(userIdOrEmail);
    print(response);
} catch on DioError (e) {
    print('Exception when calling UsersApi->getUserPresence: $e\n');
}
```

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **userIdOrEmail** | **String**| The user_id or Zulip display email address of the user whose presence you want to fetch.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 43). Previous versions only supported identifying the user by Zulip display email.  |

# **getUsers**
> JsonSuccessBase getUsers(clientGravatar, includeCustomProfileFields)

Get all users

Retrieve details on all users in the organization.  Optionally includes values of [custom profile field](/help/add-custom-profile-fields).  `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/users`  You can also [fetch details on a single user](/api/get-user). 

### Example 
```dart
import 'package:openapi/api.dart';

final api = Openapi().getUsersApi();
final bool clientGravatar = true; // bool | Whether the client supports computing gravatars URLs.  If enabled, `avatar_url` will be included in the response only if there is a Zulip avatar, and will be `null` for users who are using gravatar as their avatar.  This option significantly reduces the compressed size of user data, since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if clients can compute their own gravatars.

# **muteUser**
> JsonSuccess muteUser(mutedUserId)

Mute a user

This endpoint [mutes a user](/help/mute-a-user).  Messages sent by users you've muted will be automatically marked as read and hidden.  `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/users/me/muted_users/{muted_user_id}`  Muted users should be implemented by clients as follows:  * The server will immediately mark all messages sent by the muted   user as read.  This will automatically clear any existing mobile   push notifications related to the muted user. * The server will mark any new messages sent by the muted user as read   for your account, which prevents all email and mobile push notifications. * Clients should exclude muted users from presence lists or other UI   for viewing or composing 1:1 private messages. 1:1 private messages sent by   muted users should be hidden everywhere in the Zulip UI. * Stream messages and group private messages sent by the muted   user should avoid displaying the content and name/avatar,   but should display that N messages by a muted user were   hidden (so that it is possible to interpret the messages by   other users who are talking with the muted user). * Group private message conversations including the muted user   should display muted users as \"Muted user\", rather than   showing their name, in lists of such conversations, along with using   a blank grey avatar where avatars are displayed. * Administrative/settings UI elements for showing \"All users that exist   on this stream or realm\", e.g. for organization   administration or showing stream subscribers, should display   the user's name as normal.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 48). 

### Example 
```dart
import 'package:openapi/api.dart';

final api = Openapi().getUsersApi();
final int mutedUserId = 10; // int | The ID of the user to mute/un-mute. 

try { 
    final response = api.muteUser(mutedUserId);
    print(response);
} catch on DioError (e) {
    print('Exception when calling UsersApi->muteUser: $e\n');

# **setTypingStatus**
> JsonSuccess setTypingStatus(op, to, type, topic)

Set \"typing\" status

Notify other users whether the current user is typing a message.  `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/typing`  Clients implementing Zulip's typing notifications protocol should work as follows:  * Send a request to this endpoint with `op=\"start\"` when a user starts typing a message,   and also every `TYPING_STARTED_WAIT_PERIOD=10` seconds that the user continues to   actively type or otherwise interact with the compose UI (E.g. interacting with the   compose box emoji picker). * Send a request to this endpoint with `op=\"stop\"` when a user pauses using the   compose UI for at least `TYPING_STOPPED_WAIT_PERIOD=5` seconds or cancels   the compose action (if it had previously sent a \"start\" operation for that   compose action). * Start displaying \"Sender is typing\" for a given conversation when the client   receives an `op=\"start\"` event from the [events API](/api/get-events). * Continue displaying \"Sender is typing\" until they receive an `op=\"stop\"` event   from the [events API](/api/get-events) or `TYPING_STARTED_EXPIRY_PERIOD=15`   seconds have passed without a new `op=\"start\"` event for that conversation. * Clients that support displaying stream typing notifications (new in Zulip 4.0)   should indicate they support processing stream typing events via the   `stream_typing_notifications` in the `client_capabilities` parameter to `/register`.  This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications implementation to be stateless while being resilient; network failures cannot result in a user being incorrectly displayed as perpetually typing.  See [the typing notification docs](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/typing-indicators.html) for additional design details on Zulip's typing notifications protocol. 

### Example 
```dart
import 'package:openapi/api.dart';

final api = Openapi().getUsersApi();
final String op = start; // String | Whether the user has started (`start`) or stopped (`stop`) to type. 
final BuiltList<int> to = ; // BuiltList<int> | For 'private' type it is the user_ids of the recipients of the message being typed. Send a JSON-encoded list of user_ids. (Use a list even if there is only one recipient.)  For 'stream' type it is a single element list containing ID of stream in which the message is being typed.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 2.0, this parameter accepted only a JSON-encoded list of email addresses.

import 'package:openapi/api.dart';

final api = Openapi().getUsersApi();
final int mutedUserId = 10; // int | The ID of the user to mute/un-mute. 

try { 
    final response = api.unmuteUser(mutedUserId);

Update settings

This endpoint is used to edit the current user's settings.  `PATCH {{ api_url }}/v1/settings`  **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this endpoint only supported the `full_name`, `email`, `old_password`, and `new_password` parameters. Notification settings were managed by `PATCH /settings/notifications`, and all other settings by `PATCH /settings/display`. The feature level 80 migration to merge these endpoints did not change how request parameters are encoded. Note, however, that it did change the handling of any invalid parameters present in a request to change notification or display settings, since the merged endpoint uses the new response format that was introduced for `/settings` in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 78).  The `/settings/display` and `/settings/notifications` endpoints are now deprecated aliases for this endpoint for backwards-compatibility, and will be removed once clients have migrated to use this endpoint. 

### Example 
```dart

final bool twentyFourHourTime = true; // bool | Whether time should be [displayed in 24-hour notation](/help/change-the-time-format).  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint. 
final bool denseMode = true; // bool | This setting has no effect at present.  It is reserved for use in controlling the default font size in Zulip.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint.

# **updateStatus**
> JsonSuccess updateStatus(statusText, away, emojiName, emojiCode, reactionType)

Update your status

Change your [status](/help/status-and-availability).  `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/users/me/status`  A request to this endpoint will only change the parameters passed. For example, passing just `status_text` requests a change in the status text, but will leave the status emoji unchanged.  Clients that wish to set the user's status to a specific value should pass all supported parameters. 

### Example 
```dart
import 'package:openapi/api.dart';

final api = Openapi().getUsersApi();
final String statusText = on vacation; // String | The text content of the status message. Sending the empty string will clear the user's status.  **Note**: The limit on the size of the message is 60 characters. 
final bool away = true; // bool | Whether the user should be marked as \"away\". 
final String emojiName = car; // String | The name for the emoji to associate with this status. 
final String emojiCode = 1f697; // String | A unique identifier, defining the specific emoji codepoint requested, within the namespace of the `reaction_type`.  For example, for `unicode_emoji`, this will be an encoding of the Unicode codepoint; for `realm_emoji`, it'll be the ID of the realm emoji. 
final String reactionType = unicode_emoji; // String | One of the following values:  * `unicode_emoji`: Unicode emoji (`emoji_code` will be its Unicode   codepoint). * `realm_emoji`: [Custom emoji](/help/add-custom-emoji).   (`emoji_code` will be its ID). * `zulip_extra_emoji`: Special emoji included with Zulip.  Exists to   namespace the `zulip` emoji. 

try { 
    final response = api.updateStatus(statusText, away, emojiName, emojiCode, reactionType);
    print(response);
} catch on DioError (e) {

# **updateUser**
> JsonSuccess updateUser(userId, fullName, role, profileData)

Update a user

Administrative endpoint to update the details of another user in the organization.  `PATCH {{ api_url }}/v1/users/{user_id}`  Supports everything an administrator can do to edit details of another user's account, including editing full name, [role](/help/roles-and-permissions), and [custom profile fields](/help/add-custom-profile-fields). 

### Example 
```dart
import 'package:openapi/api.dart';

final api = Openapi().getUsersApi();
final int userId = 12; // int | The target user's ID. 
final String fullName = fullName_example; // String | The user's full name. 
final int role = 400; // int | New [role](/help/roles-and-permissions) for the user.  Roles are encoded as:  * Organization owner: 100 * Organization administrator: 200 * Organization moderator: 300 * Member: 400 * Guest: 600  Only organization owners can add or remove the owner role.

Organization moderator role added in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 60).

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**email** | **String** | The Zulip API email address of the user or bot.  If you do not have permission to view the email address of the target user, this will be a fake email address that is usable for the Zulip API but nothing else.  | [optional] 
**isBot** | **bool** | A boolean specifying whether the user is a bot or full account.  | [optional] 
**avatarUrl** | **String** | URL for the user's avatar.  Will be `null` if the `client_gravatar` query parameter was set to `True` and the user's avatar is hosted by the Gravatar provider (i.e. the user has never uploaded an avatar).  **Changes**: In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18), if the client has the `user_avatar_url_field_optional` capability, this will be missing at the server's sole discretion.  | [optional] 
**avatarVersion** | **int** | Version for the user's avatar.  Used for cache-busting requests for the user's avatar.  Clients generally shouldn't need to use this; most avatar URLs sent by Zulip will already end with `?v={avatar_version}`.  | [optional] 
**fullName** | **String** | Full name of the user or bot, used for all display purposes.  | [optional] 
**isAdmin** | **bool** | A boolean specifying whether the user is an organization administrator.  | [optional] 
**isOwner** | **bool** | A boolean specifying whether the user is an organization owner. If true, is_admin will also be true.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 8).  | [optional] 
**isBillingAdmin** | **bool** | A boolean specifying whether the user is a billing administrator.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 73).  | [optional] 
**role** | **int** | [Organization-level role](/help/roles-and-permissions)) of the user. Poosible values are:  * Organization owner => 100 * Organization administrator => 200 * Organization moderator => 300 * Member => 400 * Guest => 600  **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 59).  | [optional] 
**botType** | **int** | An integer describing the type of bot: * `null` if the user isn't a bot. * `1` for a `Generic` bot. * `2` for an `Incoming webhook` bot. * `3` for an `Outgoing webhook` bot. * `4` for an `Embedded` bot.  | [optional] 
**userId** | **int** | The unique ID of the user.  | [optional] 
**botOwnerId** | **int** | If the user is a bot (i.e. `is_bot` is `True`), `bot_owner` is the user ID of the bot's owner (usually, whoever created the bot).  Will be null for legacy bots that do not have an owner.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1).  In previous versions, there was a `bot_owner` field containing the email address of the bot's owner.  | [optional] 
**isActive** | **bool** | A boolean specifying whether the user account has been deactivated.  | [optional] 
**isGuest** | **bool** | A boolean specifying whether the user is a guest user.  | [optional] 
**timezone** | **String** | The time zone of the user.  | [optional] 
**dateJoined** | **String** | The time the user account was created.  | [optional] 
**deliveryEmail** | **String** | The user's real email address.  This field is present only if [email address visibility](/help/restrict-visibility-of-email-addresses) is limited and you are an administrator with access to real email addresses under the configured policy.  | [optional] 
**profileData** | [**BuiltMap&lt;String, JsonObject&gt;**](JsonObject.md) | A dictionary containing custom profile field data for the user. Each entry maps the integer ID of a custom profile field in the organization to a dictionary containing the user's data for that field.  Generally the data includes just a single `value` key; for those custom profile fields supporting Markdown, a `rendered_value` key will also be present.  | [optional]

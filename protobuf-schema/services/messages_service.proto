If the existing reaction was added when the Zulip server was using a previous version of the emoji data mapping between Unicode codepoints and human-readable names, sending the `emoji_code` in the data for the original reaction allows the Zulip server to correctly interpret your upvote as an upvote rather than a reaction with a \"diffenent\" emoji.

The special values of `'newest'` and `'oldest'` are also supported for anchoring the query at the most recent or oldest messages.  **Changes**: String values are new in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1).  The   `first_unread` functionality was supported in Zulip 2.1.x   and older by not sending anchor and using use_first_unread_anchor.    In Zulip 2.1.x and older, `oldest` can be emulated with   `anchor=0`, and `newest` with `anchor=10000000000000000`   (that specific large value works around a bug in Zulip   2.1.x and older in the `found_newest` return value).

If the message is successfully sent, the server will include `local_id` in the `message` event that the client with this `queue_id` will receive notifying it of the new message via [`GET /events`](/api/get-events).

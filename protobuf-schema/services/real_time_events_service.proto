  // Dictionary containing details on features the client supports that are relevant to the format of responses sent by the server.  * `notification_settings_null`: Boolean for whether the   client can handle the current API with null values for   stream-level notification settings (which means the stream   is not customized and should inherit the user's global   notification settings for stream messages).   <br />   New in Zulip 2.1.0; in earlier Zulip releases, stream-level   notification settings were simple booleans.  * `bulk_message_deletion`: Boolean for whether the client's    handler for the `delete_message` event type has been    updated to process the new bulk format (with a    `message_ids`, rather than a singleton `message_id`).    Otherwise, the server will send `delete_message` events    in a loop.    <br />    New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 13).  This    capability is for backwards-compatibility; it will be    required in a future server release.  * `user_avatar_url_field_optional`: Boolean for whether the    client required avatar URLs for all users, or supports    using `GET /avatar/{user_id}` to access user avatars.  If the    client has this capability, the server may skip sending a    `avatar_url` field in the `realm_user` at its sole discretion    to optimize network performance.  This is an important optimization    in organizations with 10,000s of users.    <br />    New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18).  * `stream_typing_notifications`: Boolean for whether the client   supports stream typing notifications.   <br />   New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58).  This capability is   for backwards-compatibility; it will be required in a   future server release.  * `user_settings_object`: Boolean for whether the client supports the modern   `user_settings` event type. If False, the server will additionally send the   legacy `update_display_settings` and `update_global_notifications` event   types for backwards-compatibility with clients that predate this API migration.   <br />   <br />   Because the feature level 89 API changes were merged together, clients can   safely make a request with this client capability and requesting all of the   `user_settings`, `update_display_settings`, and   `update_global_notifications` event types, and get exactly one copy of   settings data on any server version. (And then use the `zulip_feature_level`   in the `/register` response or the presence/absence of a `user_settings` key   to determine where to look).   <br />   New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 89).  This capability is for   backwards-compatibility; it will be removed in a future server release.

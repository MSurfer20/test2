If you do not specify this parameter, you will receive all events, and have to filter out the events not relevant to your client in your client code.  For most applications, one is only interested in messages, so one specifies: `event_types=['message']`  Event types not supported by the server are ignored, in order to simplify the implementation of client apps that support multiple server versions.

  // Dictionary containing details on features the client supports that are relevant to the format of responses sent by the server.  * `notification_settings_null`: Boolean for whether the   client can handle the current API with null values for   stream-level notification settings (which means the stream   is not customized and should inherit the user's global   notification settings for stream messages).  New in Zulip   2.1.0; in earlier Zulip releases, stream-level   notification settings were simple booleans.  * `bulk_message_deletion`: Boolean for whether the client's    handler for the `delete_message` event type has been    updated to process the new bulk format (with a    `message_ids`, rather than a singleton `message_id`).    Otherwise, the server will send `delete_message` events    in a loop.  New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 13).  This    capability is for backwards-compatibility; it will be    required in a future server release.  * `user_avatar_url_field_optional`: Boolean for whether the    client required avatar URLs for all users, or supports    using `GET /avatar/{user_id}` to access user avatars.  If the    client has this capability, the server may skip sending a    `avatar_url` field in the `realm_user` at its sole discretion    to optimize network performance.  This is an important optimization    in organizations with 10,000s of users.    New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18).  * `stream_typing_notifications`: Boolean for whether the client   supports stream typing notifications.    New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58).  This capability is   for backwards-compatibility; it will be required in a   future server release.

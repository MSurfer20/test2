## GetEvents

> JsonSuccessBase GetEvents (string queueId, int? lastEventId = null, bool? dontBlock = null)

Get events from an event queue

`GET {{ api_url }}/v1/events`  This endpoint allows you to receive new events from [a registered event queue](/api/register-queue).  Long-lived clients should use the `event_queue_longpoll_timeout_seconds` property returned by `POST /register` as the client-side HTTP request timeout for calls to this endpoint.  It is guaranteed to be higher than heartbeat frequency and should be respected by clients to avoid breaking when heartbeat frequency increases. 

### Example

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using Org.OpenAPITools.Api;
using Org.OpenAPITools.Client;
using Org.OpenAPITools.Model;

            var lastEventId = -1;  // int? | The highest event ID in this queue that you've received and wish to acknowledge. See the [code for `call_on_each_event`](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api/blob/master/zulip/zulip/__init__.py) in the [zulip Python module](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api) for an example implementation of correctly processing each event exactly once.  (optional) 
            var dontBlock = true;  // bool? | Set to `true` if the client is requesting a nonblocking reply. If not specified, the request will block until either a new event is available or a few minutes have passed, in which case the server will send the client a heartbeat event.  (optional)  (default to false)

            try
            {
                // Get events from an event queue
                JsonSuccessBase result = apiInstance.GetEvents(queueId, lastEventId, dontBlock);

## RegisterQueue

> JsonSuccessBase RegisterQueue (bool? applyMarkdown = null, bool? clientGravatar = null, bool? slimPresence = null, List<string> eventTypes = null, bool? allPublicStreams = null, bool? includeSubscribers = null, Object clientCapabilities = null, List<string> fetchEventTypes = null, List<List<string>> narrow = null)

Register an event queue

`POST {{ api_url }}/v1/register`  This powerful endpoint can be used to register a Zulip \"event queue\" (subscribed to certain types of \"events\", or updates to the messages and other Zulip data the current user has access to), as well as to fetch the current state of that data.  (`register` also powers the `call_on_each_event` Python API, and is intended primarily for complex applications for which the more convenient `call_on_each_event` API is insufficient).  This endpoint returns a `queue_id` and a `last_event_id`; these can be used in subsequent calls to the [\"events\" endpoint](/api/get-events) to request events from the Zulip server using long-polling.  The server will queue events for up to 10 minutes of inactivity. After 10 minutes, your event queue will be garbage-collected.  The server will send `heartbeat` events every minute, which makes it easy to implement a robust client that does not miss events unless the client loses network connectivity with the Zulip server for 10 minutes or longer.  Once the server garbage-collects your event queue, the server will [return an error](/api/get-events#bad_event_queue_id-errors) with a code of `BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID` if you try to fetch events from the event queue.  Your software will need to handle that error condition by re-initializing itself (e.g. this is what triggers your browser reloading the Zulip web app when your laptop comes back online after being offline for more than 10 minutes).  When prototyping with this API, we recommend first calling `register` with no `event_types` parameter to see all the available data from all supported event types.  Before using your client in production, you should set appropriate `event_types` and `fetch_event_types` filters so that your client only requests the data it needs.  A few minutes doing this often saves 90% of the total bandwidth and other resources consumed by a client using this API.  See the [events system developer documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/events-system.html) if you need deeper details about how the Zulip event queue system works, avoids clients needing to worry about large classes of potentially messy races, etc.

            var clientGravatar = true;  // bool? | Whether the client supports computing gravatars URLs.  If enabled, `avatar_url` will be included in the response only if there is a Zulip avatar, and will be `null` for users who are using gravatar as their avatar.  This option significantly reduces the compressed size of user data, since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if clients can compute their own gravatars.  (optional)  (default to false)
            var slimPresence = true;  // bool? | Setting this to `true` will make presence dictionaries be keyed by user_id instead of email.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (Unstable with no feature level yet).  (optional)  (default to false)
            var eventTypes = new List<string>(); // List<string> | A JSON-encoded array indicating which types of events you're interested in.

Otherwise, the server will send `delete_message` events    in a loop.    <br />    New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 13).  This    capability is for backwards-compatibility; it will be    required in a future server release.  * `user_avatar_url_field_optional`: Boolean for whether the    client required avatar URLs for all users, or supports    using `GET /avatar/{user_id}` to access user avatars.  If the    client has this capability, the server may skip sending a    `avatar_url` field in the `realm_user` at its sole discretion    to optimize network performance.  This is an important optimization    in organizations with 10,000s of users.    <br />    New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18).  * `stream_typing_notifications`: Boolean for whether the client   supports stream typing notifications.   <br />   New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58).  This capability is   for backwards-compatibility; it will be required in a   future server release.  * `user_settings_object`: Boolean for whether the client supports the modern   `user_settings` event type. If False, the server will additionally send the   legacy `update_display_settings` and `update_global_notifications` event   types for backwards-compatibility with clients that predate this API migration.   <br />   <br />   Because the feature level 89 API changes were merged together, clients can   safely make a request with this client capability and requesting all of the   `user_settings`, `update_display_settings`, and   `update_global_notifications` event types, and get exactly one copy of   settings data on any server version. (And then use the `zulip_feature_level`   in the `/register` response or the presence/absence of a `user_settings` key   to determine where to look).   <br />   New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 89).  This capability is for   backwards-compatibility; it will be removed in a future server release.  (optional)

If `fetch_event_types` is not provided, `event_types` is used and if `event_types` is not provided, this parameter defaults to `None`.  Event types not supported by the server are ignored, in order to simplify the implementation of client apps that support multiple server versions.  (optional) 
            var narrow = new List<List<string>>(); // List<List<string>> | A JSON-encoded array of arrays of length 2 indicating the narrow for which you'd like to receive events for.

(And then use the &#x60;zulip_feature_level&#x60;   in the &#x60;/register&#x60; response or the presence/absence of a &#x60;user_settings&#x60; key   to determine where to look).   &lt;br /&gt;   New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 89).  This capability is for   backwards-compatibility; it will be removed in a future server release.  | [optional] 
 **fetchEventTypes** | [**List&lt;string&gt;**](string.md)| Same as the &#x60;event_types&#x60; parameter except that the values in &#x60;fetch_event_types&#x60; are used to fetch initial data. If &#x60;fetch_event_types&#x60; is not provided, &#x60;event_types&#x60; is used and if &#x60;event_types&#x60; is not provided, this parameter defaults to &#x60;None&#x60;.  Event types not supported by the server are ignored, in order to simplify the implementation of client apps that support multiple server versions.  | [optional] 
 **narrow** | [**List&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;**](List&lt;string&gt;.md)| A JSON-encoded array of arrays of length 2 indicating the narrow for which you&#39;d like to receive events for. For instance, to receive events for the stream &#x60;Denmark&#x60;, you would specify &#x60;narrow&#x3D;[[&#39;stream&#39;, &#39;Denmark&#39;]]&#x60;.  Another example is &#x60;narrow&#x3D;[[&#39;is&#39;, &#39;private&#39;]]&#x60; for private messages. Default is &#x60;[]&#x60;.  | [optional]

     * GET /events : Get events from an event queue
     * &#x60;GET {{ api_url }}/v1/events&#x60;  This endpoint allows you to receive new events from [a registered event queue](/api/register-queue).  Long-lived clients should use the &#x60;event_queue_longpoll_timeout_seconds&#x60; property returned by &#x60;POST /register&#x60; as the client-side HTTP request timeout for calls to this endpoint.  It is guaranteed to be higher than heartbeat frequency and should be respected by clients to avoid breaking when heartbeat frequency increases.

(optional)
     * @param dontBlock Set to &#x60;true&#x60; if the client is requesting a nonblocking reply.

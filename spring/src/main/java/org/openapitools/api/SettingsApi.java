     * PATCH /settings : Update settings
     * This endpoint is used to edit the current user&#39;s settings.  &#x60;PATCH {{ api_url }}/v1/settings&#x60;  **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this endpoint only supported the &#x60;full_name&#x60;, &#x60;email&#x60;, &#x60;old_password&#x60;, and &#x60;new_password&#x60; parameters. Notification settings were managed by &#x60;PATCH /settings/notifications&#x60;, and all other settings by &#x60;PATCH /settings/display&#x60;. The feature level 80 migration to merge these endpoints did not change how request parameters are encoded. Note, however, that it did change the handling of any invalid parameters present in a request to change notification or display settings, since the merged endpoint uses the new response format that was introduced for &#x60;/settings&#x60; in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 78).  The &#x60;/settings/display&#x60; and &#x60;/settings/notifications&#x60; endpoints are now deprecated aliases for this endpoint for backwards-compatibility, and will be removed once clients have migrated to use this endpoint. 
     *
     * @param fullName A new display name for the user.  (optional)
     * @param email Asks the server to initiate a confirmation sequence to change the user&#39;s email address to the indicated value. The user will need to demonstrate control of the new email address by clicking a confirmation link sent to that address.  (optional)
     * @param oldPassword The user&#39;s old Zulip password (or LDAP password, if LDAP authentication is in use).  Required only when sending the &#x60;new_password&#x60; parameter.  (optional)
     * @param newPassword The user&#39;s new Zulip password (or LDAP password, if LDAP authentication is in use).  The &#x60;old_password&#x60; parameter must be included in the request.  (optional)
     * @param twentyFourHourTime Whether time should be [displayed in 24-hour notation](/help/change-the-time-format).  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the &#x60;PATCH /settings/display&#x60; endpoint.  (optional)
     * @param denseMode This setting has no effect at present.  It is reserved for use in controlling the default font size in Zulip.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the &#x60;PATCH /settings/display&#x60; endpoint.  (optional)

(optional)
     * @param enableDraftsSynchronization A boolean parameter to control whether synchronizing drafts is enabled for the user.

     * @param leftSideUserlist Whether the users list on left sidebar in narrow windows.  This feature is not heavily used and is likely to be reworked.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the &#x60;PATCH /settings/display&#x60; endpoint.  (optional)
     * @param emojiset The user&#39;s configured [emoji set](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#use-emoticons), used to display emoji to the user everything they appear in the UI.  * \&quot;google\&quot; - Google modern * \&quot;google-blob\&quot; - Google classic * \&quot;twitter\&quot; - Twitter * \&quot;text\&quot; - Plain text  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the &#x60;PATCH /settings/display&#x60; endpoint.

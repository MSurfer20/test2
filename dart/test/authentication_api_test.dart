    // For easy testing of mobile apps and other clients and against Zulip development servers, we support fetching a Zulip API key for any user on the development server without authentication (so that they can implement analogues of the one-click login process available for Zulip development servers on the web).  **Note:** This endpoint is only available on Zulip development servers; for obvious security reasons it will always return an error in a Zulip production server.  `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/dev_fetch_api_key`

    //Future<ApiKeyResponse> devFetchApiKey(String username) async

    // Fetch an API key (production)
    //
    // This API endpoint is used by clients such as the Zulip mobile and terminal apps to implement password-based authentication.  Given the user's Zulip login credentials, it returns a Zulip API key that the client can use to make requests requests as the user.  This endpoint is only useful for Zulip servers/organizations with EmailAuthBackend or LDAPAuthBackend enabled.  The Zulip mobile apps also support SSO/social authentication (GitHub auth, Google auth, SAML, etc.) that does not use this endpoint.  Instead, the mobile apps reuse the web login flow passing the `mobile_flow_otp` in a webview, and the credentials are returned to the app (encrypted) via a redirect to a `zulip://` URL.  !!! warn \"\"     **Note:** If you signed up using passwordless authentication and     never had a password, you can [reset your password](/help/change-your-password).      See the [API keys](/api/api-keys) documentation for     more details on how to download API key manually.  In a [Zulip development environment](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/overview.html), see also [the unauthenticated variant](/api/dev-fetch-api-key).

    /**
     Register an event queue
     - POST /register
     - `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/register`  This powerful endpoint can be used to register a Zulip \"event queue\" (subscribed to certain types of \"events\", or updates to the messages and other Zulip data the current user has access to), as well as to fetch the current state of that data.  (`register` also powers the `call_on_each_event` Python API, and is intended primarily for complex applications for which the more convenient `call_on_each_event` API is insufficient).  This endpoint returns a `queue_id` and a `last_event_id`; these can be used in subsequent calls to the [\"events\" endpoint](/api/get-events) to request events from the Zulip server using long-polling.  The server will queue events for up to 10 minutes of inactivity. After 10 minutes, your event queue will be garbage-collected.  The server will send `heartbeat` events every minute, which makes it easy to implement a robust client that does not miss events unless the client loses network connectivity with the Zulip server for 10 minutes or longer.  Once the server garbage-collects your event queue, the server will [return an error](/api/get-events#bad_event_queue_id-errors) with a code of `BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID` if you try to fetch events from the event queue.  Your software will need to handle that error condition by re-initializing itself (e.g. this is what triggers your browser reloading the Zulip web app when your laptop comes back online after being offline for more than 10 minutes).  When prototyping with this API, we recommend first calling `register` with no `event_types` parameter to see all the available data from all supported event types.  Before using your client in production, you should set appropriate `event_types` and `fetch_event_types` filters so that your client only requests the data it needs.  A few minutes doing this often saves 90% of the total bandwidth and other resources consumed by a client using this API.  See the [events system developer documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/events-system.html) if you need deeper details about how the Zulip event queue system works, avoids clients needing to worry about large classes of potentially messy races, etc.

This is an important optimization    in organizations with 10,000s of users.    &lt;br /&gt;    New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18).  * &#x60;stream_typing_notifications&#x60;: Boolean for whether the client   supports stream typing notifications.   &lt;br /&gt;   New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58).  This capability is   for backwards-compatibility; it will be required in a   future server release.  * &#x60;user_settings_object&#x60;: Boolean for whether the client supports the modern   &#x60;user_settings&#x60; event type. If False, the server will additionally send the   legacy &#x60;update_display_settings&#x60; and &#x60;update_global_notifications&#x60; event   types for backwards-compatibility with clients that predate this API migration.   &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;   Because the feature level 89 API changes were merged together, clients can   safely make a request with this client capability and requesting all of the   &#x60;user_settings&#x60;, &#x60;update_display_settings&#x60;, and   &#x60;update_global_notifications&#x60; event types, and get exactly one copy of   settings data on any server version. (And then use the &#x60;zulip_feature_level&#x60;   in the &#x60;/register&#x60; response or the presence/absence of a &#x60;user_settings&#x60; key   to determine where to look).   &lt;br /&gt;   New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 89).  This capability is for   backwards-compatibility; it will be removed in a future server release.  (optional)
     - parameter fetchEventTypes: (query) Same as the &#x60;event_types&#x60; parameter except that the values in &#x60;fetch_event_types&#x60; are used to fetch initial data. If &#x60;fetch_event_types&#x60; is not provided, &#x60;event_types&#x60; is used and if &#x60;event_types&#x60; is not provided, this parameter defaults to &#x60;None&#x60;.  Event types not supported by the server are ignored, in order to simplify the implementation of client apps that support multiple server versions.  (optional)
     - parameter narrow: (query) A JSON-encoded array of arrays of length 2 indicating the narrow for which you&#39;d like to receive events for. For instance, to receive events for the stream &#x60;Denmark&#x60;, you would specify &#x60;narrow&#x3D;[[&#39;stream&#39;, &#39;Denmark&#39;]]&#x60;.  Another example is &#x60;narrow&#x3D;[[&#39;is&#39;, &#39;private&#39;]]&#x60; for private messages. Default is &#x60;[]&#x60;.  (optional)

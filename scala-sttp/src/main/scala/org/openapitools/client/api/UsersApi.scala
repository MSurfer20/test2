   * Notify other users whether the current user is typing a message.  `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/typing`  Clients implementing Zulip's typing notifications protocol should work as follows:  * Send a request to this endpoint with `op=\"start\"` when a user starts typing a message,   and also every `TYPING_STARTED_WAIT_PERIOD=10` seconds that the user continues to   actively type or otherwise interact with the compose UI (E.g. interacting with the   compose box emoji picker). * Send a request to this endpoint with `op=\"stop\"` when a user pauses using the   compose UI for at least `TYPING_STOPPED_WAIT_PERIOD=5` seconds or cancels   the compose action (if it had previously sent a \"start\" operation for that   compose action). * Start displaying \"Sender is typing\" for a given conversation when the client   receives an `op=\"start\"` event from the [events API](/api/get-events). * Continue displaying \"Sender is typing\" until they receive an `op=\"stop\"` event   from the [events API](/api/get-events) or `TYPING_STARTED_EXPIRY_PERIOD=15`   seconds have passed without a new `op=\"start\"` event for that conversation. * Clients that support displaying stream typing notifications (new in Zulip 4.0)   should indicate they support processing stream typing events via the   `stream_typing_notifications` in the `client_capabilities` parameter to `/register`.  This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications implementation to be stateless while being resilient; network failures cannot result in a user being incorrectly displayed as perpetually typing.  See [the typing notification docs](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/typing-indicators.html) for additional design details on Zulip's typing notifications protocol.

Support for the email address-based format was removed in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 11).

   * This endpoint is used to edit the current user's settings.  `PATCH {{ api_url }}/v1/settings`  **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this endpoint only supported the `full_name`, `email`, `old_password`, and `new_password` parameters. Notification settings were managed by `PATCH /settings/notifications`, and all other settings by `PATCH /settings/display`. The feature level 80 migration to merge these endpoints did not change how request parameters are encoded. Note, however, that it did change the handling of any invalid parameters present in a request to change notification or display settings, since the merged endpoint uses the new response format that was introduced for `/settings` in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 78).  The `/settings/display` and `/settings/notifications` endpoints are now deprecated aliases for this endpoint for backwards-compatibility, and will be removed once clients have migrated to use this endpoint. 
   * 
   * Expected answers:

   * @param fullName A new display name for the user. 
   * @param email Asks the server to initiate a confirmation sequence to change the user's email address to the indicated value. The user will need to demonstrate control of the new email address by clicking a confirmation link sent to that address. 
   * @param oldPassword The user's old Zulip password (or LDAP password, if LDAP authentication is in use).  Required only when sending the `new_password` parameter. 
   * @param newPassword The user's new Zulip password (or LDAP password, if LDAP authentication is in use).  The `old_password` parameter must be included in the request.

   * @param denseMode This setting has no effect at present.  It is reserved for use in controlling the default font size in Zulip.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint. 
   * @param starredMessageCounts Whether clients should display the [number of starred messages](/help/star-a-message#display-the-number-of-starred-messages).  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint.

   * @param enableDraftsSynchronization A boolean parameter to control whether synchronizing drafts is enabled for the user. When synchronization is disabled, all drafts stored in the server will be automatically deleted from the server.  This does not do anything (like sending events) to delete local copies of drafts stored in clients.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 87). 
   * @param translateEmoticons Whether to [translate emoticons to emoji](/help/enable-emoticon-translations) in messages the user sends.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint. 
   * @param defaultLanguage What [default language](/help/change-your-language) to use for the account.  This controls both the Zulip UI as well as email notifications sent to the user.  The value needs to be a standard language code that the Zulip server has translation data for; for example, `\"en\"` for English or `\"de\"` for German.  **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint.

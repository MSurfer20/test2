/// @param subscriptions A list of dictionaries containing the key &#x60;name&#x60; and value specifying the name of the stream to subscribe. If the stream does not exist a new stream is created. The description of the stream created can be specified by setting the dictionary key &#x60;description&#x60; with an appropriate value.

When &#x60;True&#x60;, an authorization error is reported as such. When set to &#x60;False&#x60;, the response will be a 200 and any streams where the request encountered an authorization error will be listed in the &#x60;unauthorized&#x60; key.  (optional) (default to @(YES))

/// @param inviteOnly As described above, this endpoint will create a new stream if passed a stream name that doesn&#39;t already exist.  This parameters and the ones that follow are used to request an initial configuration of a created stream; they are ignored for streams that already exist.  This parameter determines whether any newly created streams will be private streams.  (optional) (default to @(NO))
/// @param historyPublicToSubscribers Whether the stream&#39;s message history should be available to newly subscribed members, or users can only access messages they actually received while subscribed to the stream.

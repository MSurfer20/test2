# OpenapiClient::AttachmentsMessages

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **date_sent** | **Integer** | Time when the message was sent as a UNIX timestamp multiplied by 1000 (matching the format of getTime() in JavaScript).  **Changes**: Changed in Zulip 2.2 (feature level 22).  This field was previously strangely called &#x60;name&#x60; and was a floating point number.  | [optional] |
| **id** | **Integer** | The unique message ID.  Messages should always be displayed sorted by ID.  | [optional] |

## Example

```ruby
require 'openapi_client'

instance = OpenapiClient::AttachmentsMessages.new(
  date_sent: null,
  id: null
)
```

    (* The URL of the user's avatar.  Can be null only if client_gravatar was passed, which means that the user has not uploaded an avatar in Zulip, and the client should compute the gravatar URL by hashing the user's email address itself for this user.  *)
    avatar_url: string option [@default None];
    (* A Zulip \''client\'' string, describing what Zulip client sent the message.  *)

    (* The content/body of the message.  *)
    content: string option [@default None];
    (* The HTTP `content_type` for the message content.  This will be `text/html` or `text/x-markdown`, depending on whether `apply_markdown` was set.  *)
    content_type: string option [@default None];
    (* Data on the recipient of the message; either the name of a stream or a dictionary containing basic data on the users who received the message.  *)
    display_recipient: One_ofstringarray.t option [@default None];
    (* The unique message ID.  Messages should always be displayed sorted by ID.  *)

    (* The `topic` of the message.  Currently always `\''\''` for private messages, though this could change if Zulip adds support for topics in private message conversations.  The field name is a legacy holdover from when topics were called \''subjects\'' and will eventually change.  *)

    (* Data on any links to be included in the `topic` line (these are generated by [custom linkification filters](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) that match content in the message's topic.)  **Changes**: This field contained a list of urls before   Zulip 4.0 (feature level 46).  New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1): Previously, this field was called `subject_links`; clients are recommended to rename `subject_links` to `topic_links` if present for compatibility with older Zulip servers.  *)

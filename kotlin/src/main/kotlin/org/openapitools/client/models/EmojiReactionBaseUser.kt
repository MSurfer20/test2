 * Dictionary with data on the user who added the reaction, including the user ID as the `id` field.  **Note**: In the [events API](/api/get-events), this `user` dictionary confusing had the user ID in a field called `user_id` instead.  We recommend ignoring fields other than the user ID.  **Deprecated** and to be removed in a future release once core clients have migrated to use the `user_id` field.

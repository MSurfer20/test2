This will automatically clear any existing mobile   push notifications related to the muted user. * The server will mark any new messages sent by the muted user as read   for your account, which prevents all email and mobile push notifications. * Clients should exclude muted users from presence lists or other UI   for viewing or composing 1:1 private messages. 1:1 private messages sent by   muted users should be hidden everywhere in the Zulip UI. * Stream messages and group private messages sent by the muted   user should avoid displaying the content and name/avatar,   but should display that N messages by a muted user were   hidden (so that it is possible to interpret the messages by   other users who are talking with the muted user). * Group private message conversations including the muted user   should display muted users as \&quot;Muted user\&quot;, rather than   showing their name, in lists of such conversations, along with using   a blank grey avatar where avatars are displayed. * Administrative/settings UI elements for showing \&quot;All users that exist   on this stream or realm\&quot;, e.g. for organization   administration or showing stream subscribers, should display   the user&#39;s name as normal.  **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 48).

  # Set \&quot;typing\&quot; status
  # Notify other users whether the current user is typing a message.  &#x60;POST {{ api_url }}/v1/typing&#x60;  Clients implementing Zulip&#39;s typing notifications protocol should work as follows:  * Send a request to this endpoint with &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;start\&quot;&#x60; when a user starts typing a message,   and also every &#x60;TYPING_STARTED_WAIT_PERIOD&#x3D;10&#x60; seconds that the user continues to   actively type or otherwise interact with the compose UI (E.g. interacting with the   compose box emoji picker). * Send a request to this endpoint with &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;stop\&quot;&#x60; when a user pauses using the   compose UI for at least &#x60;TYPING_STOPPED_WAIT_PERIOD&#x3D;5&#x60; seconds or cancels   the compose action (if it had previously sent a \&quot;start\&quot; operation for that   compose action). * Start displaying \&quot;Sender is typing\&quot; for a given conversation when the client   receives an &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;start\&quot;&#x60; event from the [events API](/api/get-events). * Continue displaying \&quot;Sender is typing\&quot; until they receive an &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;stop\&quot;&#x60; event   from the [events API](/api/get-events) or &#x60;TYPING_STARTED_EXPIRY_PERIOD&#x3D;15&#x60;   seconds have passed without a new &#x60;op&#x3D;\&quot;start\&quot;&#x60; event for that conversation. * Clients that support displaying stream typing notifications (new in Zulip 4.0)   should indicate they support processing stream typing events via the   &#x60;stream_typing_notifications&#x60; in the &#x60;client_capabilities&#x60; parameter to &#x60;/register&#x60;.  This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications implementation to be stateless while being resilient; network failures cannot result in a user being incorrectly displayed as perpetually typing.  See [the typing notification docs](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/typing-indicators.html) for additional design details on Zulip&#39;s typing notifications protocol.

Notification settings were managed by &#x60;PATCH /settings/notifications&#x60;, and all other settings by &#x60;PATCH /settings/display&#x60;. The feature level 80 migration to merge these endpoints did not change how request parameters are encoded. Note, however, that it did change the handling of any invalid parameters present in a request to change notification or display settings, since the merged endpoint uses the new response format that was introduced for &#x60;/settings&#x60; in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 78).  The &#x60;/settings/display&#x60; and &#x60;/settings/notifications&#x60; endpoints are now deprecated aliases for this endpoint for backwards-compatibility, and will be removed once clients have migrated to use this endpoint.
